# Plan: Full-Stack Monorepo Base Template

This document has two parts:

---

## Goals / Non-goals

- **Goals**: Production-ready developer workflows + CI, deterministic tests (unit/integration/E2E), secure-by-default patterns (OWASP-aligned), and a configurable artifact publishing flow.
- **Non-goals**: Avoid expanding into app-specific product features unless they directly support the repo’s “template” purpose.

## Success Criteria (Definition of Done)

- A clean checkout can run `pnpm -w install`, `pnpm -w lint`, and core tests successfully.
- E2E tests are deterministic (seeded) and can run without manual setup.
- Publish flow works in dry-run and real mode, and is registry-agnostic via env.

## BDD Governance (Requirements + Status)

- Every major capability in this repo should have a corresponding Cucumber scenario as the source of truth for the requirement.
- Status is governed by tags:
  - `@wip`: requirement captured but not implemented yet (disabled by default)
  - `@ready`: implemented and runnable in CI
  - `@manual`: requirement tracked but validated manually
  - `@skip`: temporarily disabled
- Default BDD runs execute only `@ready` scenarios; use `pnpm bdd:status` for an at-a-glance status summary.

### Reporting note

- TODO: Backend Cucumber JSON report output is currently disabled (HTML is self-contained but `apps/backend/reports/cucumber-report.json` can appear empty). We should fix/clarify this later to avoid confusion.

---

## Current Focus (Execution Status)

### Overview

- Goal: Make this monorepo production-ready with reliable developer workflows and CI, hardened pre-push checks, deterministic integration tests, and a simple, configurable artifact publishing flow.

### Recent changes (delta)

- Hardened `pre-push` to run a fast backend test gate and added `scripts/run-backend-tests-ci.js` to force mocks for external services in local dev.
- Converted many high-value `@security` BDD scenarios into integration tests and wired Cucumber step-definitions to use in-memory services (AuditLogService, AuthorizationService, CacheService). Added cache-backed rate limiter tests and mock Redis support.
- Chosen artifact registry: GitHub Packages selected (see Advanced Features for placement). A registry-agnostic publish flow will allow CI and local dev to swap to an internal registry exposed via the service mesh by setting `REGISTRY_URL` and `NPM_AUTH_TOKEN`.
- **✅ COMPLETED (Dec 2024)**: Migrated to ESLint v9 flat config, fixed pre-commit hooks (lint-staged, TypeScript, commitlint working end-to-end).
- **✅ COMPLETED (Dec 2024)**: Implemented owner-based authorization (`:own` semantics), integrated audit logging into AuthorizationService, added test helpers (`clear()`, `resetForTests()`).
- **✅ COMPLETED (Dec 2024)**: Made integration tests resilient to external services - tests skip gracefully when `TEST_EXTERNAL_SERVICES=false` or dependencies unavailable. Test suite runs in ~11s without external connections.

### Completed Work (WSJF Prioritized)

### High Priority (WSJF > 4.3)

- ✅ **Option 3** (WSJF 5.67) - Audit test helpers: Added `clear()` method to AuditLogService, implemented `:own` permission semantics in AuthorizationService with audit logging, created integration test (commit `8b8d710`)
- ✅ **Option 1** (WSJF 5.00) - ESLint/lint-staged fix: Migrated to ESLint v9 flat config format, fixed Husky pre-commit and commit-msg hooks (commit `86f14b6`)
- ✅ **Options 5-7** (WSJF 4.33) - Test resilience: Added skip logic to external-service-dependent tests, extended ESLint config for test files, removed unused variables (commit `a28779f`)

### Medium Priority (WSJF ~4.0)

- ✅ **Option 8** (WSJF 4.50) - Publish dry-run: Created registry-agnostic publish script, .npmrc.template, configured @apkasten906/types package, documented publishing workflow, validated with dry-run (commit `cc9fbad`)
- ✅ **Option 2** (WSJF 4.00) - GitHub Actions publish workflow: Implemented automated publishing with manual dispatch, tag triggers, and release integration; supports dry-run and internal registries (commit `20aa32c`)
- ✅ **Option 6** (WSJF 4.00) - Verdaccio in-cluster manifest: Created complete Kubernetes manifests with Istio integration, ConfigMap, PVC, security hardening, comprehensive deployment documentation (commit `db8f4fd`)
- ✅ **Option 5** (WSJF 3.67) - Wire Cucumber steps to integration harness: All Cucumber step definitions wired to integration tests with in-memory services (AuditLogService, AuthorizationService, CacheService), added cache-backed rate limiter tests, mock Redis support

### Low Priority (WSJF ~2.8)

- ✅ **Option 4** (WSJF 2.78) - Full ABAC/policy engine expansion: Implemented comprehensive ABAC policy engine with PolicyEngine, PolicyStore, deny-overrides strategy, AND/OR/NOT logical operators, 9 comparison operators, 4 attribute sources, example policies (time-based, department-based, ownership, location), integrated with AuthorizationService maintaining backward-compatible RBAC (commit `888e75a`)

### Next Priorities

- ✅ **Deterministic E2E seeding (WSJF 7.33)** - `POST /api/e2e/seed` is token-protected and wired into CI. Playwright prefers reusing existing dev servers when reachable, with `REUSE_EXISTING_SERVER` override. Docs updated to reflect triggers and env vars (see `apps/frontend/docs/E2E_TESTING.md`).
- ✅ **CI DRY & Hardening (Feb 2026)** - Extracted shared Node+pnpm setup into a hardened composite action `.github/actions/setup-node-pnpm` (simplified API: removed free-form `install-args`, uses explicit `frozen-lockfile` input), rewired workflows to use it, and added `.github/actions/` to `CODEOWNERS`.
- ✅ **Dependabot reduced (Feb 2026)** - `.github/dependabot.yml` reduced to GitHub Actions only per solo-maintainer preference; npm/package updates will be handled manually for now.
- ✅ **Docs: Frontend build verification (Feb 2026)** - Verified `apps/frontend` production build locally and added a short note and Windows caveat to `SETUP.md`.
- ✅ **Correlation IDs for request tracing** - End-to-end correlation-id propagation (`X-Correlation-ID`) across frontend (middleware + browser/SSR) and backend (Express + Winston injection), with tests + docs + ADR 013 (see `docs/CORRELATION_ID.md`, `docs/adr/013-correlation-ids-for-request-tracing.md`).
- 📌 **Deployable template WSJF backlog (2026-01-25)** - If/when we shift focus to “deployable template” hardening, use `/docs/Planning/wsjf-deployable-template.md` as the WSJF-scored sub-backlog to avoid expanding this plan with lots of sub-bullets.
- ✅ **Code Quality** - ESLint improvements completed (0 errors, 0 warnings) - commits `8e94d79`, `59f4c95`, `3ccab31`, `06d74f6`
- ✅ **Testing Infrastructure - Storage** - Storage Service tests completed (28 tests) - commit `646dfbb`
- ✅ **Testing Infrastructure - Notifications** - NotificationService tests completed (24 tests) - commit `dc88870`
- ✅ **Testing Infrastructure - Webhooks** - WebhookService tests completed (25 tests) - commit `8a03485`
- ✅ **Testing Infrastructure - Secrets** - SecretsManagerService tests completed (35 tests) - commit `b8d2566`
- ✅ **BDD Scenario Coverage** - All 15 `@security` scenarios converted to integration tests (commit `f90746d`); mapping: `docs/bdd-coverage-analysis.md`
- ✅ **Artifact Registry Publishing** - Registry-agnostic publish flow verified (commit `d422d55`); docs: `docs/PUBLISHING.md`, ADR-009
- ✅ **Prisma 7 CLI Migration Workaround** - Hybrid migration approach documented (commit `d394653`); docs: ADR-010
- ✅ **Frontend i18n (WSJF 6.92)** - Internationalization in 4 languages (commit `8495821`); docs: `apps/frontend/docs/INTERNATIONALIZATION.md`
- ✅ **Frontend error handling (WSJF 5.85)** - Error boundaries + resilient API client (commit `e09febf`); docs: `apps/frontend/docs/ERROR_HANDLING.md`
- ✅ **Docker infrastructure (WSJF 5.38 + 5.00)** - Production-ready Docker + Compose (commit `c7f7c2e`); docs: `docs/DOCKER.md`
- ✅ **Queue system (WSJF 4.62)** - BullMQ queues + dashboard (commit `c201cb5`); docs: `docs/QUEUE_SYSTEM.md`
- ✅ **WebSocket support (WSJF 4.15)** - Socket.io auth + scaling (commit `cb2f5c4`); docs: `docs/WEBSOCKET.md`
- **Test Status (2025-12-14)**: 170 passing / 108 skipped (skips expected when `TEST_EXTERNAL_SERVICES=false`)
- **Current Status (Feb 2026)**: Core features complete with comprehensive testing, i18n, error handling, Docker, queues, WebSockets, and CI/CD hardening complete
- **Next (Feb 2026)**: Implement Observability Stack (Phase 11) - Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger, centralized logging, APM, alerting

### Priorities (A / B / C from original plan)

1. ✅ **B (COMPLETED)**: Convert `@security` BDD scenarios to integration tests and make tests resilient to external services (MockRedis, toggles). All 15 critical security scenarios now covered.
2. ✅ **C (COMPLETED)**: Finalize artifact registry and publishing flow (GitHub Packages default), add `scripts/publish-packages.js`, `.npmrc.template`, and GitHub Actions publish workflow. Make publish flow registry-agnostic via `REGISTRY_URL` so we can route to an internal registry through the service mesh. All components verified and tested.
3. ✅ **A (COMPLETED)**: Investigate Prisma CLI/migrations issue, propose workaround, and write ADR for migration strategy. Upgraded to Prisma 7.1.0, documented CLI config parsing bug, implemented hybrid migration strategy (manual SQL + Prisma 6 fallback). See ADR-010.

### Actionable steps (short-term)

- ✅ DONE (WSJF 7.33): Deterministic E2E seeding is wired into CI and documented.
- ✅ DONE: Add lightweight persona management for forks (persona registry + optional JSON override via `E2E_PERSONAS_FILE`).
- 🟡 DONE (not merged): Expanded seeded personas minimally (added `moderator` + `MODERATOR` role) to keep fixtures deterministic and ready for new tests. (branch: `chore/e2e-personas-moderator`)
- ✅ DONE (merged): CI workflow DRY hardening: extracted shared Node+pnpm setup into a composite action and reused it across core workflows. (branch: `chore/ci-dry-workflows`, PR #29)
- ✅ DONE (Feb 2026): Hardened composite action API (removed `install-args`) and validated workflows.
- ✅ DONE (Feb 2026): Reduced Dependabot to Actions-only and updated plan/docs.
- ⬜ NEXT: Continue Enhanced CI/CD hardening (Dependabot validation + workflow review policy). Merge `chore/e2e-personas-moderator` when ready.
- ✅ DONE: Finish converting remaining `@security` scenarios to integration tests and wire any missing Cucumber step-definitions to the integration harness. All 15 scenarios now covered. (owner: dev)
- ✅ DONE: Add a registry-agnostic publish script and GitHub Actions workflow that defaults to GitHub Packages but respects `REGISTRY_URL` and `NPM_AUTH_TOKEN` for an internal registry. (owner: dev)
- ✅ DONE: Create ADR documenting the artifact registry decision and how to swap registries through the service mesh. (owner: dev) — see `docs/adr/009-artifact-registry-github-packages.md`.
- ✅ DONE: Add an optional `test-setup` (Vitest `setupFiles`) to set `REDIS_MOCK=true` and `TEST_EXTERNAL_SERVICES=false` for local/CI fast gates.
- ✅ DONE: Fix all TypeScript compilation errors (29 errors resolved - test files + frontend tsconfig)
- ✅ DONE: Auto-fix ESLint issues (75 issues fixed - import ordering, missing globals, parser config)
- ✅ DONE: Implement full ABAC policy engine (PolicyEngine, PolicyStore, deny-overrides, operators, attribute sources, example policies, docs)
- ✅ DONE: Address ESLint code quality issues - achieved 0 errors, 0 warnings (100% clean - all 154 problems resolved with justifications)
- ✅ DONE: Add comprehensive Storage Service unit tests (28 tests covering all file operations, MIME validation, health checks)
- ✅ DONE: Improve cache service type safety - eliminated `any` types with IRedisClient interface (-11 warnings)
- ✅ DONE: Replace remaining `any` types with `unknown` and type aliases (query-helpers, policy-engine) - improved type safety with runtime guards
- ✅ DONE: Complete BDD @security scenario integration test coverage (JWT generation/validation, OWASP headers) - 18 new tests added

### In flight (branches on hold)

- `chore/e2e-personas-moderator`: Adds `moderator` persona + `MODERATOR` role to backend seed + frontend fixtures; keeps dev auth fallback aligned.

### Notes on service-mesh friendliness

- The publish flow will be registry-agnostic. To swap in an internal registry that lives inside the cluster (Verdaccio, Artifactory, Nexus), set CI `REGISTRY_URL` to a stable internal address (e.g. `http://npm-registry.svc.cluster.local:4873`) and provide `NPM_AUTH_TOKEN` in secrets. The service mesh can expose/secure that endpoint; the CI/publish scripts remain unchanged.

### Next check-in

- **Current Focus (Feb 2026)**: Begin implementation of **Phase 11: Observability Stack**. Priority order:
  1. Prometheus metrics collection (service mesh + application metrics)
  2. Grafana dashboards (performance, infrastructure, business KPIs)
  3. Distributed tracing with Jaeger (automatic via Istio + custom spans)
  4. Centralized logging (choose ELK Stack or Loki + Grafana)
  5. APM integration (Datadog or New Relic)
  6. Alerting and incident management (Prometheus Alertmanager + PagerDuty/OpsGenie)
  7. Kiali for service mesh observability
- **Decision Point**: Choose between ELK Stack (full-featured, resource-intensive) or Loki (cost-effective, Grafana-native) for centralized logging based on infrastructure constraints and team preferences.
- **Documentation**: Create ADR for observability stack decisions, update SETUP.md with observability setup instructions.
- **Future**: After observability foundation is complete, continue with next WSJF priority items or shift to deployable template hardening using `/docs/Planning/wsjf-deployable-template.md` as the backlog.

## Target Blueprint

Create a production-ready base repository for rapidly starting new web applications with a Next.js frontend, Node.js backend, comprehensive testing, and DevOps infrastructure. The setup follows SOLID principles with dependency injection, includes logging/monitoring, PostgreSQL database support, OWASP security standards, Istio service mesh for infrastructure concerns, and is Kubernetes and CI/CD ready.

## Steps

### 1. Initialize monorepo foundation

Set up Turborepo with pnpm workspaces, create `apps/frontend` (Next.js) and `apps/backend` (Node.js/Express) directories, configure shared TypeScript configs, ESLint with OWASP security rules, Prettier, Husky git hooks, and commitlint for conventional commits

### 2. Establish project governance and security framework

Implement OWASP-compliant security standards, create security governance documentation, set up DI pattern for security library abstraction (authentication, authorization, encryption), configure OWASP Dependency-Check in CI pipeline, establish security review process, and create threat modeling documentation

### 3. Build backend architecture

Implement SOLID-compliant layers (controllers, services, repositories, entities) with TSyringe DI container, integrate Prisma with PostgreSQL schema including read replica configuration for horizontal read scaling, add Winston/Morgan/Sentry logging, configure Swagger/OpenAPI documentation with HATEOAS, set up Zod environment validation with separate configs per environment, implement header-based API versioning, configure multi-level caching strategy (in-memory L1, Redis L2, CDN L3), and implement webhook management system with delivery queue and retry logic

### 4. Configure authentication and authorization

Implement OAuth 2.0 + OpenID Connect (OIDC) with DI pattern for security provider abstraction, integrate Passport.js with pluggable strategies, add NextAuth.js for frontend, implement JWT handling with refresh tokens, create RBAC and permission-based authorization middleware, and add security audit logging

### 5. Configure frontend application

Initialize Next.js 14+ with App Router, create shared packages (`types`, `utils`, `constants`, `config`) for frontend-backend type safety, integrate Sentry error tracking, establish API client with HATEOAS support, add proper error boundaries, set up i18n with next-i18next for multilingual support (en, es, fr, de initially)

### 6. Establish testing infrastructure

Configure Vitest for unit tests in both apps with coverage reporting, set up Cucumber with example feature files and step definitions, integrate Playwright for E2E tests with Page Object Model pattern, add OWASP ZAP for security testing integration, and create test utilities for each testing type

### 7. Implement infrastructure services

Integrate Redis for caching/sessions with DI abstraction, set up Bull/BullMQ for message queuing and background jobs, implement WebSocket support with Socket.io and authentication, create health check endpoints for all services, and configure graceful shutdown handling

### 8. Implement file storage and advanced features

Add Multer for file uploads with DI storage adapter pattern (local/S3/Azure/GCP), implement feature flag system, configure cloud storage adapters with environment-based selection, add OWASP file upload security validations, and create comprehensive documentation

### 9. Integrate Istio service mesh

Install Istio in Kubernetes cluster, configure mTLS for service-to-service communication, set up VirtualServices for header-based API versioning and traffic management, create DestinationRules for circuit breakers and retry policies, implement AuthorizationPolicies for network-level security, configure distributed tracing with Jaeger, and set up Kiali for service mesh visualization

### 10. Implement additional service abstractions

Add notification service with DI (email, SMS, push notifications), implement search service abstraction (Elasticsearch, Algolia, MeiliSearch), create event bus interface (Redis Pub/Sub, RabbitMQ, Kafka), add payment gateway abstraction (Stripe, PayPal), implement analytics service (Mixpanel, Segment), and configure secrets management (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)

### 11. Implement DevOps and production infrastructure

Create multi-stage Dockerfiles with security scanning, set up docker-compose.yml for local development, configure Kubernetes manifests for all services, set up GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD (lint, test, build, E2E, security scans), implement APM integration (Datadog, New Relic), configure log aggregation (ELK Stack, Loki), add load testing with k6, implement database backup and recovery strategies, and create comprehensive monitoring and alerting

## Technology Decisions (Confirmed)

✅ **Package Manager**: pnpm
✅ **Service Mesh**: Istio for mTLS, traffic management, observability
✅ **Orchestration**: Kubernetes (production), Docker Compose (local dev)
✅ **Security Governance**: OWASP standards with DI pattern for security libraries
✅ **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 + OpenID Connect (OIDC) via Passport.js abstraction
✅ **Infrastructure**: Redis, Bull/BullMQ (message queuing), Socket.io (WebSockets)
✅ **API Versioning**: Header-based with HATEOAS principles (Istio routing)
✅ **Internationalization**: Yes, using next-i18next
✅ **File Storage**: Local with DI pattern for cloud provider abstraction
✅ **Additional Services**: Notification, Search, Event Bus, Payment, Analytics (all with DI)
✅ **Secrets Management**: HashiCorp Vault or cloud provider native
✅ **Observability**: Istio + Jaeger (tracing), Prometheus + Grafana (metrics), ELK/Loki (logs)

## Recommended Authentication Provider

For OAuth 2.0 + OpenID Connect implementation, I recommend:

**Option A: Auth0 (Recommended for Speed)**

- Managed service, fastest to implement
- Excellent Next.js/Node.js SDKs
- Built-in RBAC and MFA
- Social login providers ready
- **Pros**: Quick setup, battle-tested, great DX
- **Cons**: Paid service (free tier available), vendor lock-in risk

**Option B: Keycloak (Recommended for Control)**

- Self-hosted, open-source
- Full OIDC/OAuth2 compliance
- Highly customizable
- No external dependencies
- **Pros**: Complete control, free, extensible
- **Cons**: Requires hosting/maintenance, steeper learning curve

**Option C: Passport.js with Custom OIDC**

- Build custom with passport-oauth2 strategy
- DI pattern for swappable providers
- Complete flexibility
- **Pros**: No vendor lock-in, full customization
- **Cons**: More implementation work, need to maintain

**Recommendation**: Start with **Passport.js abstraction layer** that can use any OIDC provider, then implement **Auth0** for quick start with ability to swap to Keycloak or custom later.

10. **SSRF** - URL validation, allow-list approach

**Security Practices**:

- Regular dependency audits (npm audit, Snyk, OWASP Dependency-Check)
- Static Application Security Testing (SAST) in CI
- Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) with OWASP ZAP
- Secret scanning (GitHub Advanced Security, GitGuardian)
- Container security scanning (Trivy, Snyk)
- Security code reviews for sensitive components
- Penetration testing guidelines
- Incident response procedures

**DI Pattern for Security Libraries**:

```typescript
// Security abstraction interfaces
interface IAuthenticationProvider {
  authenticate(credentials: any): Promise<AuthResult>;
  validateToken(token: string): Promise<TokenPayload>;
  refreshToken(refreshToken: string): Promise<TokenResult>;
}

  decrypt(data: string): Promise<string>;
  hash(data: string): Promise<string>;
  compareHash(data: string, hash: string): Promise<boolean>;
}

interface IStorageProvider {

  download(path: string): Promise<File>;
  delete(path: string): Promise<void>;
  getSignedUrl(path: string, expiresIn: number): Promise<string>;

}

interface ISearchService {
  index(document: SearchDocument): Promise<void>;
  search(query: SearchQuery): Promise<SearchResults>;
  deleteIndex(id: string): Promise<void>;
}

  subscribe(eventType: string, handler: EventHandler): void;
}

interface IPaymentService {
  createPaymentIntent(amount: number, currency: string): Promise<PaymentIntent>;
  processPayment(paymentId: string): Promise<PaymentResult>;
  refund(paymentId: string, amount?: number): Promise<RefundResult>;
}

interface IAnalyticsService {
  track(event: string, properties?: Record<string, any>): Promise<void>;
  identify(userId: string, traits?: Record<string, any>): Promise<void>;
  page(name: string, properties?: Record<string, any>): Promise<void>;
}

interface ISecretsManager {
  getSecret(key: string): Promise<string>;
  setSecret(key: string, value: string): Promise<void>;
  deleteSecret(key: string): Promise<void>;
}

interface IWebhookService {
  register(url: string, events: string[], secret: string): Promise<WebhookRegistration>;
  unregister(webhookId: string): Promise<void>;
  deliver(webhookId: string, event: WebhookEvent): Promise<DeliveryResult>;
  verifySignature(payload: string, signature: string, secret: string): boolean;
  retry(deliveryId: string): Promise<DeliveryResult>;
  getDeliveryStatus(deliveryId: string): Promise<DeliveryStatus>;
}

interface ICacheService {
  get<T>(key: string, level?: CacheLevel): Promise<T | null>;
  set<T>(key: string, value: T, ttl?: number, level?: CacheLevel): Promise<void>;
  delete(key: string, level?: CacheLevel): Promise<void>;
  invalidate(pattern: string): Promise<void>;
}

interface IFeatureFlagService {
  isEnabled(flagKey: string, context?: FlagContext): Promise<boolean>;
  getVariant(flagKey: string, context?: FlagContext): Promise<string | null>;
  getAllFlags(context?: FlagContext): Promise<Record<string, boolean>>;
  createFlag(flag: FeatureFlag): Promise<void>;
  updateFlag(flagKey: string, updates: Partial<FeatureFlag>): Promise<void>;
  deleteFlag(flagKey: string): Promise<void>;
  evaluateRollout(flagKey: string, context?: FlagContext): Promise<boolean>;
}

## HATEOAS API Design with Istio

### Header-Based Versioning (Istio VirtualService Routing)

```http
GET /api/users/123
Accept-version: 1.0.0
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

**Istio VirtualService routes based on Accept-version header:**

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: backend-api
spec:
  hosts:
    - backend-api
