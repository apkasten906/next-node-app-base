Got it: “deployable template” changes the priority set a lot. Yes—worth a quick WSJF refresh, but we can keep it lightweight.

First, one guardrail check (so you don’t get blocked later):

Confirm branch protection no longer requires the paused checks (Workflow Lint…, Backend Unit Tests…). If they’re still required, PRs will hang “Expected”.

Now, here’s a proposed “deployable template” backlog with initial WSJF scores (assumptions: single maintainer, goal is a repeatable deploy with docs; WSJF = (Business Value + Time Criticality + Risk Reduction) / Job Size; 1–10 scale).

## Deployable template backlog (initial WSJF)

### Define deployment target + architecture (single VM? container platform? k8s?)

WSJF: (10+10+8)/2 = 14.0

Output: chosen platform + constraints + “definition of done” for deploy

### Production-ready configuration + env templates

WSJF: (10+9+8)/3 = 9.0

Output: .env.example completeness, secrets list, prod-safe defaults

### Containerization + minimal deploy path (Docker Compose or platform manifests)

WSJF: (10+9+7)/4 = 6.5

Output: build/run instructions for prod, health checks, ports, volumes

### Backend build/start (no “ts-node in prod”) + migration/seed strategy

WSJF: (9+8+8)/4 = 6.25

Output: pnpm build produces runnable artifact; migrations documented

### Frontend production build + runtime config

WSJF: (9+7+6)/3 = 7.33

### One-click “smoke test” script for deployed instance

WSJF: (7+7+7)/2 = 10.5

### Observability baseline (structured logs + basic metrics/health)

WSJF: (6+6+7)/3 = 6.33

## Follow-up questions

Two quick questions so I can finalize the WSJF and give you an exact next-step plan:

1. Where should this be deployable to first? Pick one:

- Docker Compose on a VPS
- Fly.io / Render / Railway
- AWS (ECS) / Azure (Container Apps) / GCP (Cloud Run)
- Kubernetes (k8s)

2. “Deployable” means which of these?

- Frontend + backend only (no external deps required)
- Includes Postgres + Redis in the deploy story too

Reply with the two numbers (e.g., “1 and 2”), and I’ll re-score WSJF with your constraints and propose the top 3 tasks to do next (with concrete file changes).

User answer: Q1 = option 3 (AWS/Azure/GCP managed container platform), Q2 = option 2 (includes Postgres + Redis).
