# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for this project.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

## Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

- **Title**: Short noun phrase
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
- **Context**: The issue motivating this decision
- **Decision**: The change being proposed or has been agreed upon
- **Consequences**: What becomes easier or more difficult after this change

## Index

| ADR | Title | Status | Date |
|-----|-------|--------|------|
| [001](./001-node-js-25-native-typescript.md) | Use Node.js 25 for Native TypeScript Support | Accepted | 2025-11-20 |
