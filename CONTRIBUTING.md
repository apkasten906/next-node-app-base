## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check the existing issues to avoid duplicates. When you create a bug report, include as many details as possible:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title**
- **Describe the exact steps to reproduce the problem**
- **Provide specific examples**
- **Describe the behavior you observed and what you expected**
- **Include screenshots if relevant**
- **Include your environment details** (OS, Node version, etc.)

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. When creating an enhancement suggestion:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title**
- **Provide a detailed description of the suggested enhancement**
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful**
- **List any similar features in other projects if applicable**

### Pull Requests

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `master`
2. **Set up your development environment** using Dev Containers (recommended) or local setup
3. **Make your changes** following our coding standards
4. **Add tests** for your changes
5. **Ensure all tests pass** (`pnpm test`)
6. **Update documentation** if needed
7. **Commit your changes** using conventional commits
8. **Push to your fork** and submit a pull request

### GitHub Actions: SHA-Pinned Actions

This repository pins GitHub Actions to **immutable commit SHAs** (instead of floating tags like `@v4`).

Why:

- **Reproducibility**: workflow behavior can’t change under your feet.
- **Supply-chain hardening**: reduces risk from tag retargeting or compromised upstream releases.

What it looks like:

```yaml
uses: actions/checkout@3df4ab11eba7bda6032a0b82a6bb43b11571feac # v4
```

#### How to bump a pinned action

1. Decide the target release/tag (example: `v4`).
2. Resolve the tag to a commit SHA:

   ```bash
   git ls-remote https://github.com/actions/checkout.git "refs/tags/v4" "refs/tags/v4^{}"
   ```

   Notes:
   - If the tag is annotated, you’ll see two lines; use the `^{}` (“peeled”) commit SHA.
   - If you see only one line, that SHA is the commit.

3. Update all occurrences in `.github/workflows/*.yml` to the new SHA and keep the `# vX` comment.
4. Let CI validate the change (GitHub will refuse unknown SHAs / repos).

Optional: consider enabling Dependabot for `github-actions` updates to keep pins current.

Review guidance for CI/workflow changes: `docs/Planning/WORKFLOW_CHANGE_REVIEW_PLAYBOOK.md`.

## Development Setup

### Using Dev Containers (Recommended)

1. Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
2. Install the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
3. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/next-node-app-base.git`
4. Open in VSCode and click "Reopen in Container"
5. Wait for the container to build and dependencies to install

### Local Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/next-node-app-base.git
cd next-node-app-base

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env.development

# Start development services
docker-compose up -d

# Run migrations
pnpm db:migrate

# Start development servers
pnpm dev
```

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow strict TypeScript configuration
- Avoid `any` types unless absolutely necessary
- Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes

### Code Style

- We use Prettier for code formatting
- We use ESLint for code linting
- Run `pnpm format` before committing
- Run `pnpm lint:fix` to fix linting issues

### Commit Messages

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```text
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `build`: Build system or dependency changes
- `ci`: CI configuration changes
- `chore`: Other changes
- `security`: Security improvements

**Examples:**

```git
feat(backend): add webhook management system

Implement webhook registration, delivery queue, and retry logic
with HMAC signature verification.

Closes #123
```

```git
fix(frontend): resolve memory leak in WebSocket connection

The WebSocket connection was not being properly cleaned up on
component unmount, causing memory leaks.

Fixes #456
```

### Testing

- Write unit tests for all new features
- Write integration tests for API endpoints
- Write E2E tests for critical user flows
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Run tests before submitting PR: `pnpm test`

## Git hooks

This repository uses Husky to run local Git hooks that help keep the codebase healthy.

- `pre-commit`: runs `lint-staged` (Prettier + ESLint) and a quick TypeScript check for changed files.
- `commit-msg`: runs `commitlint` to enforce conventional commit messages.
- `pre-push`: runs a fast backend test gate using `scripts/run-backend-tests-ci.js --quick` which sets `TEST_EXTERNAL_SERVICES=false` and `REDIS_MOCK=true` so tests run quickly and deterministically locally.

If a hook fails locally, fix the reported issues and re-run the hook commands manually (or re-commit). CI will run the same checks and will block merges on failures.

### Documentation

- Update README.md if you change functionality
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Update relevant documentation in `docs/`
- Include examples for new features
